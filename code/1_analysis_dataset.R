### 1 - Housekeeping ----

#   loading packages
library(dplyr)
library(haven)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(reshape2)
library(tidylog)

#   set filepaths and extract dates with script 0

### Step 1 - Extract database, drop unnecessary columns and save as R file
## Bringing in optins version, as could produce opt-in report from same file

raw_db <- read_sav(sbsdb_path)

slim_db <- raw_db %>% select(
  -(PATSNAME:HBRES),
  -FIT_THRESH,
  -ERR,
  -(final_date_round:transf06),
  -transf14,
  -(workaround:HBIDENT),
  -PRECOLAS,
  -FURTHASS,
  -(BARENCTC:BARCTDAT),
  -POLYP,
  -POLYPECT,
  -(MORT:diff)
) %>%
  clean_names()

## glimpse() shows that date fields are being correctly read in
## 9,454,841 records


### Remove flexi. sig. study participants

## Merge on to bs database
