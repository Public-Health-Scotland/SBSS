### Step 1: Ensure hbres and postcode data are available ----

# Bring in analysis database from script 1

names(analysis_db)
# Yes.


#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# This used to not be true. We now longer need this section but retaining for now.
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Bring in full database as well
# so we can recover hbres and postcode (which were excluded from analysis_db)
# can then match these postcodes onto the Scottish Postcode Directory
# to obtain Highland North and Highland South data.

#          clean_names() %>%
#          select(chinum, patpcode, date_round, hbres) %>%

# Create a new analysis_db by joining analysis_db and raw_db, 
# keeping records for patients present in both, according to patient and round.

# create new postcode variable without spaces for matching
#mutate(patpcode = str_remove(patpcode, " "))
# This #analysis_db2 would then be plugged in below.
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


# Bring in Scottish postcode directory so we can get hb2006 geographies
spd <- read_rds(paste0("/conf/linkage/output/lookups/Unicode/Geography/",
                       "Scottish Postcode Directory/",

# this code updates the SIMD and waiting times data on lines 44-98 of the HB reports
# lines 2-43 are functions, which calculate KPIs from the data in lines 44-98.
# Once code below is run and Excel files are saved, they must be open manually,
# and you must press: "Ctrl shift alt F9" to update all the function in the tab.

## North
north <- HB_KPI("North")

## South
south <- HB_KPI("South")


### Step 6: Write to excel ----


# North

# South

write_hb_report(south, "Highland_South")
