### Step 0: Housekeeping ----

# Loading packages

library(dplyr)
library(haven)
library(sjlabelled)
library(janitor)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(openxlsx)

library(zoo)
library(tidylog)

# Install/open the PHSmethods package
# install.packages("remotes")
# library(remotes)
# remotes::install_github("Public-Health-Scotland/phsmethods", upgrade = "never")
library(phsmethods)

rm(list = ls())

# Define current data extract folder name

extract_folder <- "2023-05"

# Define cancer registry extract folder for last extract

scr_folder_1 <- "20210809"
scr_folder_2 <- "20220208"
scr_folder_3 <- "20220805"
scr_folder_4 <- "20230221"
scr_folder_5 <- "20230804"

# Define filepaths

                     "Publications/SBoSP-Statistics/")

sbs_db_path <- paste0("/PHI_conf/CancerGroup1/Topics/BowelScreening/Data/",
                      "Programme/", extract_folder,

### Step 1: Get most recent bowel screening file ----

# Read in latest bowel screening file
# Remove SPSS formatting and labels as not required for this work

sbs_db <- read_rds(sbs_db_path) %>% 
  zap_formats() %>%
  zap_widths() %>%
  remove_all_labels() %>%

# 11,405,091 records, May 2022
# 11,874,205 records, Nov 2022
# 12,344,464 records, May 2023


### Step 2: Prepare current extract data ----

# Extract screen-detected cancers for the most recent two-year period cancer 
# diagnoses (reduce this to most recent 6 months if required)
# In the SPSS, we used to select the period in question based on date 
# colonoscopy performed, but this can't be right - not everyone who has a 
# cancer has a datecolperf, so we 'lost' (filtered out) relevant cases

cancer_reg_data <- sbs_db %>%
                   filter(between(invdate, as_date(date_first), 
                                  as_date(date_last)))

### Step 3: Compare with last extract ----

# There was no cancer reg extract for this run - left as tibble for now
# Next time we can move extract 2 to extract 1 and going forward should be fine

# storing them as characters
