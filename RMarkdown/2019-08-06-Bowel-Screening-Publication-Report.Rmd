<Div custom-style = "Heading 2_pgbrk">Introduction</div>
The Scottish Bowel Screening Programme commenced a phased roll out in June 2007 and by December 2009 all NHS Boards in Scotland were participating in the Programme.

This publication relates to men and women registered with a Community Health Index number aged between 50-74 years who are invited to participate and to be screened every two years. Eligible people are posted a screening kit which is completed at home. Since 1 April 2013 those over the age of 74 can self-refer and opt into bowel screening.

The test kit used has historically been the guaiac faecal occult blood test (FOBT), which requires participants to collect two samples from each of three separate bowel movements. On the 20th of November 2017 however, the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme started using quantitative faecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits. This new kit only requires one sample to be collected rather than 3.

As people are invited to participate every two years, the entire population should have had the opportunity to be screened in a two-year period. Published statistics cover two-year periods in order to give full coverage of the screening population. This current release includes data for people invited between 1 November 2015 and 31 October 2017. This means that the reported statistics contain data from both the new and old kits, unless these are stated separately. Trend charts shows data by 2-year intervals from 1st November to 31st October e.g. 2007/09 covers 1st November 2007 to 31st October 2009.

Where performance of the FIT and FOBT kits are reported separately, the time periods used are 20th November 2017 to 31st October 2018 (FIT) and 20th November 2016 to 31st October 2017 (FOBT).

In February 2012 the Scottish Government formally launched the Detect Cancer Early programme with the aim of increasing the early detection of cancer by 25%. The standard concentrates on breast, colorectal (bowel) and lung cancers. Part of this initiative has been focusing on raising awareness of bowel screening.

The publication report summarises the Key Performance Indicators which are a series of measures used to monitor and evaluate the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme. The Key Performance Indicators report is a series of percentages with some demographic information in the form of raw numbers.

When making comparisons across NHS Boards, it should be noted that the percentage figures for some measures may be exaggerated for some NHS Boards due to the small numbers involved in the calculations. This can be seen in many cases with the island NHS Boards. For this reason the mainland NHS Boards may only be used when quoting ranges for the health boards.

Details of all bowel screening statistics included within this publication can be found in the [bowel screening Key Performance Indicators report](https://isdscotland.scot.nhs.uk/Health-Topics/Cancer/Publications/2019-08-06/2019-08-06-Bowel-Screening-KPI-Report.xlsx).

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2_pgbrk">Main Points</div>
* 64% of people returned their test kit for FIT in the year since the test was launched (Nov17 to Oct-18). This is the first time the uptake has been better than the standard of 60%. This is
in comparison to only 55% uptake for an earlier period for FOBT (Nov-16 to Apr-17).
* The FIT also had a higher percentage of patients with a positive result than the FOBT (1.9% vs
3.1%)
* Ever since the bowel screening programme was launched, uptake has been lower in areas of
higher deprivation. The gap between the lowest and highest areas of deprivation was smaller
for FIT than for FOBT (20.8 vs 23.7 percentage points respectively).
* For adenomas (a benign growth that may develop into cancer in the future) both the detection rate (1.0% vs 0.6%) and positive predictive value (40% vs. 44%) are higher for FIT than FOBT
* For cancer the detection rate was slightly higher (0.12% vs. 0.11%) however the positive predictive value was lower (5.2% vs. 6.8%) for FIT than FOBT. This reflects the higher sensitivity of the test for blood.

### Bowel Screening Uptake
The overall uptake is the percentage of people with a final outright screening test result from all of those invited i.e. the percentage returning a correctly completed kit.
The overall uptake by NHS Board for the two-year period November 2016 to October 2018 is shown in Table 1. During this period over 1.8 million people were invited and more than one million took up the offer and achieved an outright positive or negative test result.

The overall uptake for Scotland was 59.5% for 2016/18, an increase of 3.6 percentage points on 2015/17 (55.9%). The Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) standard and bowel screening programme target for uptake is 60%.


The overall uptake for FIT versus FOBT is shown in Figure 1. The data show that there is a large increase in uptake associated with FIT vs. FOBT (64% vs. 55%). This may be due in part to the relative simplicity of FIT, which requires only 1 sample versus 3 for FOBT.

</div>  


### Overall bowel screening uptake by deprivation
Uptake of bowel screening by deprivation category is shown in Figure 2. Uptake was poorer with increasing deprivation overall and separately in men and women.  Although uptake is generally higher in women compared with men, the absolute effects of deprivation are slightly greater in women.

When areas with similar levels of deprivation are compared, there are still large differences in uptake. For example, uptake in the most deprived areas of Lothian (42.1%) was 11.6 percentage points lower than in the most deprived areas of the Borders (53.7% - see Table 2 in the Bowel Screening KPI report).  This may suggest that there are additional local factors that influence how deprivation affects likelihood of bowel screening uptake.

1.	Deprivation category shown is the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) quintiles for 2016
</div>

Analysis of FIT vs. FOBT shows that FIT introduction is associated with the largest improvement in uptake for those in the most deprived areas. This has lead to the uptake difference between the most and least deprived to decrease from  23.7 to 20.8 percentage points.

</div>

### Positivity
2.1% of people who completed the screening test received a positive result, although this varied across Scotland and by sex. The positive bowel screening test result percentage in Scotland was 2.5% in men and 1.7% in women.

Analysis of FIT vs. FOBT (figure 3) shows there to be a large increase in positivity associated with FIT, from 1.9% to 3.2%, respectively. The FIT level of positivity is higher than that recorded as part of a pilot trial of FIT in Scotland, which was 2.4%^4^. The reasons underlying this are unclear and require further investigation.

The highest positive screening test result percentage in the mainland boards for men and women was in NHS Lanarkshire with 3.6% for males and 2.5% for females 
Higher positivity percentages have been observed in areas with large concentrations of deprivation (Ayrshire and Arran, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Lanarkshire). These high positivity percentages do not, however, translate into higher levels of detection for cancer or adenoma^2^.

### Percentage of colonoscopies performed
Colonoscopy is the first line examination following a positive screening test. In Scotland, 77.3% of people with a positive test went on to have a colonoscopy performed, although this varied across Scotland and by sex (Figure 5). The main reasons for individuals not proceeding to colonoscopy were that they declined the offer or that it was clinically inappropriate. Individuals already on surveillance programmes may not always proceed to colonoscopy after a positive screening test as their surveillance colonoscopy may have been undertaken recently.

In the mainland NHS Boards, the percentage of people with a positive bowel screening test result going on to have a colonoscopy performed varied from 71.8% (NHS Lothian) to 84.7% (NHS Dumfries and Galloway).

### Bowel cancer detection
This section examines the percentage of people with bowel cancer detected out of those who completed a screening test i.e. those who received an outright positive or negative test result.
The cancer detection rate was slightly higher for FIT (0.12%) than FOBT (0.11%). This is consistent with recently published findings from other screening programmes^5^.
More cancers were detected in men than in women (0.15% in males and 0.08% in females) and the rate varied across the mainland NHS Boards from 0.12% to 0.18% in men and 0.06% to 0.14% in women.

### Dukes Staging
Dukes’ staging is the process of determining the extent to which bowel cancer has developed and spread. For the majority of patients with bowel cancer it is common practice to assign a letter from A to D to a cancer, with A indicating the cancer is confined to the bowel and D indicating that it has further spread to other more distant organs. Patients diagnosed with stage A disease tend to have better outcomes and longer survival compared to patients diagnosed with stage D disease. 
9 out of 10 patients diagnosed with bowel cancer at Dukes’ stage A will be cured of that cancer. More than 8 in 10 patients will be cured of a Dukes’ stage B cancer^5^.
The percentage of screen detected bowel cancers that were diagnosed at the earliest two stages (Dukes’ stages A or B) was 60.3%. Of these, 38.6% of cancers were diagnosed at Dukes A and 21.7% of cancers diagnosed at Dukes B.

### Adenoma detection
This section examines the percentage of people whose most serious diagnosis was adenoma (i.e. no colorectal cancer found) out of those who completed a screening test. Adenoma can be a precursor to cancer and can be classed as high, medium, low, or unclassified risk depending on size and number.
The adenoma detection rate for FIT was 1.0% vs. 0.6% for FOBT. 
Screening detected twice as many adenomas in men as in women. The percentage of adenoma detected in Scotland was 1.2% for men and 0.6% in women (Figure 8). 
The overall percentage of adenoma detection varied across mainland NHS Boards from 0.98% to 1.36% in men and 0.45% to 0.63% in women

### Positive predictive value of current screening test for bowel cancer
The positive predictive value of the current bowel screening test for bowel cancer in Scotland was 5.7%. This was lower for FIT at 5.2% than FOBT at 6.8%.
Of those that had a positive screening test result and subsequently a colonoscopy 6.2% of men and 5.1% of women had a bowel cancer.

### Positive predictive value of current screening test for adenoma
The positive predictive value of the current bowel screening test for adenoma as the most serious diagnosis was 42.2%. This was higher for FIT at 43.5% than FOBT at 40.0%.
Of those that had a positive screening test result and subsequently a colonoscopy 48.2% of men and 34.3% of women had adenoma as the most serious diagnosis.

### Appendix 1 - Background information
In screening programmes when the screening test is first applied to the population, this is known as the prevalence round since it is to be expected that a number of prevalent cases will be detected. Potentially, some of these tumours may have been present for a number of years without causing symptoms or signs. In subsequent rounds of screening the cases detected will be known to have arisen in a fixed time period and these are known as incidence rounds. In the case of bowel screening the interval between rounds is two years.
Tayside, Grampian and Fife NHS Boards participated in the Scottish Bowel Screening Pilot which ran from March 2000 to May 2007. The pilot was successful and these Boards then proceeded to roll out in June 2007. The Pilot Boards and the other NHS Boards have completed their prevalence round and are now established in their incidence round. NHS Boards are also at different points within the rounds. Direct comparisons must be treated with caution; the publication in August 2012 was the first report with all NHS Boards in their incidence rounds.
Due to small numbers of positive test results recorded for NHS Orkney, NHS Western Isles and NHS Shetland any comparison of figures with these NHS Boards should also be treated with caution. 

Health Board boundary changes
On 1st April 2014, Scottish NHS Board boundaries were changed to align with those of local authorities. The purpose of this change was to help NHS Boards and local authorities to work closer together in the provision of care in the community. More information on the background to this change can be found on the [Scottish Government website](http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/2013/06/boundaries). The Boards most affected were NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lanarkshire. Over 72,000 people were transferred from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to NHS Lanarkshire. There were also over 16,000 people transferred from NHS Lanarkshire to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.
