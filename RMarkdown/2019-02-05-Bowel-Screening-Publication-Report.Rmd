National Statistics status means that the official statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value. They are identified by the quality mark shown above.
They comply with the Code of Practice for statistics and are awarded National Statistics status following an assessment by the UK Statistics Authority's regulatory arm. The Authority considers whether the statistics meet the highest standards of Code compliance, including the value they add to public decisions and debate.

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2_pgbrk">Introduction</div>
The Scottish Bowel Screening Programme commenced a phased roll out in June 2007 and by December 2009 all NHS Boards in Scotland were participating in the Programme.

This publication relates to men and women registered with a Community Health Index number aged between 50-74 years who are invited to participate and to be screened every two years. Eligible people are posted a screening kit which is completed at home. The guaiac faecal occult blood test (FOBT) involves collecting two samples from each of three separate bowel movements. The kit is then returned to the central screening centre in Dundee and tested for hidden traces of blood in the stool. Since 1 April 2013 those over the age of 74 can self-refer and opt into bowel screening.

In February 2012 the Scottish Government formally launched the Detect Cancer Early programme with the aim of increasing the early detection of cancer by 25%. The standard concentrates on breast, colorectal (bowel) and lung cancers. Part of this initiative has been focusing on raising awareness of bowel screening.

As people are invited to participate every two years, the entire population should have had the opportunity to be screened in a two-year period. Published statistics cover two-year periods in order to give full coverage of the screening population. This current release includes data for people invited between 1 November 2015 and 31 October 2017. Trend charts shows data by 2-year intervals from 1st November to 31st October e.g. 2007/09 covers 1st November 2007 to 31st October 2009.
The Scottish Bowel Screening Programme started using quantitative faecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits instead of FOBT from 20th November 2017. As the period of this report ends 31st October 2017, this report does not contain any data on the new quantitative FIT kit. This data will be available in the February 2019 report.

The publication report summarises the Key Performance Indicators which are a series of measures used to monitor and evaluate the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme. The Key Performance Indicators report is a series of percentages with no raw numbers shown.

In addition to the Key Performance Indicators, the trend in bowel screening uptake since the start of the programme is also reported. This uses rolling 2-year periods from November until October to mirror the reporting period of the KPI report; this is the latest data available.

When making comparisons across NHS Boards, it should be noted that the percentage figures for some measures may be exaggerated for some NHS Boards due to the small numbers involved in the calculations. This can be seen in many cases with the island NHS Boards. For this reason the mainland NHS Boards may only be used when quoting ranges for the health boards.

Details of all bowel screening statistics included within this publication can be found in the [bowel screening Key Performance Indicators report](https://isdscotland.scot.nhs.uk/Health-Topics/Cancer/Publications/2018-08-07/2018-08-07-Bowel-Screening-KPI-Report.xlsx).

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2_pgbrk">Main Points</div>
* Uptake for the bowel screening test reached a high of 57.8% in 2012/14 and has gradually decreased to 55.6% in 2015/17
For the two-year period November 2015 to October 2017:
* The overall uptake for Scotland was 55.6%, which was less than the uptake reported for the period 1 November 2014 to 31 October 2016 (56.6%).
* Uptake was lower in areas of higher deprivation. Uptake in the most deprived group was 42.3% compared with 65.3% in the least deprived group.
* 2.1% of those returning their screening kit received a positive test result. Of those with a positive test result, 6.4% had a bowel cancer and 37.5% had an adenoma (a benign growth that may develop into cancer in the future).
* Three out of five screening-detected cancers (62.5%) were diagnosed at the earliest two stages. The earlier a cancer is detected the greater the chances are of successful treatment.

<Div custom-style = "Heading 2_pgbrk">Results and Commentary</div>
Please note that all tables and charts are based on the 2014 Health Board configuration, see Appendix A1 for more information.

### Bowel Screening Uptake
The overall uptake is the percentage of people with a final outright screening test result from all of those invited. It includes only people successfully completing a bowel screening test i.e. an outright positive or negative result – this accounts for 99% of returned kits.
The overall uptake by NHS Board for the two-year period November 2015 to October 2017 is shown in Table 1. During this period over 1.8 million people were invited and more than one million took up the offer and achieved an outright positive or negative test result.

The overall uptake for Scotland was 55.6%, which was less than the uptake reported for the period 1 November 2014 to 31 October 2016 (56.6%). The Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) standard and bowel screening programme target for uptake is 60%. The uptake between individual mainland boards ranged from 51.0% (NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde) to 61.8% (NHS Borders).

The overall uptake by NHS Board and sex for the two-year period November 2015 to October 2017 is shown in Figure 1.

In Scotland, uptake was 58.7% for females and 52.5% for males. In the mainland boards,  the group with the highest uptake was females living in NHS Borders (65.2%) and the group with the lowest uptake was males living in NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde (48.0%). The difference between the two groups may be due to there being more deprived areas in NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde and also that males are less likely to participate in bowel screening.
