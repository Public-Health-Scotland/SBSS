### 1 - Housekeeping ----
# clear workspace if not already clear
rm(list = ls())

#   loading packages
library(dplyr)
library(haven)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(reshape2)

#   setting filepaths and extract dates

### Step 1 - Extract database, drop unnecessary columns and save as R file
## Note - may make sense to do this as separate script/create the count 
## variables before using further scripts for different sections KPIs, 
## time-series, funnel, demography, comparison, etc.
## Bringing in optins version, as could produce opt-in report from same file

raw_db <- read_sav(paste0("/PHI_conf/CancerGroup1/Topics/BowelScreening/Data/",

  -(MORT:diff)

## glimpse() shows that date fields are being correctly read in
## Test?
## Tests also for screres, simd etc?

### Remove flexi. sig. study participants
